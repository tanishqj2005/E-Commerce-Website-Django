# E-Commerce-Website-Django
I created an E Commerce Website Using Django Backend. It has 2 components Shop and Blog. 
The Blog is integrated with facebook likes and shares whereas the shop is very realistic with Paytm integrated in it.
It displays products based on category and even has active search feature.
